# Job Hunt RPG â€” Mobile Home (StackBlitz Ready)

This is a **mobile-optimized** Home screen build for the Job Hunt RPG prototype.
It uses React + Vite + Tailwind, with `framer-motion`, `lucide-react`, and `recharts`.

## Run locally
```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```
Then open the URL shown (usually http://localhost:5173).

## StackBlitz
- Create a new StackBlitz project by importing this repo (upload these files or point to a GitHub repo).
- It will auto-install and run `vite`.

## Notes
- This build focuses on the **Home** screen only. Use the **Log application** action to open the form modal.
- Safe area insets and `100dvh` are used for a better mobile experience.
